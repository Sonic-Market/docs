Order books on Clober, with its design choice to remove the burden of claiming from the taker and rigorous gas optimizations by building novel data structures from scratch, achieved what was once deemed impossible, a Fully On-chain Order Book on EVM that can scale. On-chain order books are arguably the holy grail of DeFi, a fair, trustless, and permissionless way to facilitate trades without sacrificing the composability smart contracts offer.

As trading volume migrates from CeFi to DeFi, assets will be priced on order book DEXs instead of being ruthlessly arbitraged into equilibrium on AMMs. Financial instruments such as options, bonds, and prediction markets can finally find their home in DeFi, with liquidity supplied where AMMs cannot. (These assets have expiration dates, and therefore the impermanent loss is destined to happen when they expire. Only order books can properly provide liquidity for them without sacrificing capital efficiency.)
