## Clober Liquidity Vault (CLV)

### What is CLV
The Clober Liquidity Vault (CLV) allows users to passively provide liquidity to Clober's on-chain orderbook. By depositing assets into the CLV, liquidity providers can earn profits from the bid-ask spread generated through the vault's active market-making strategies. This means that while users do not need to actively manage their positions, the CLV works on their behalf to capitalize on trading opportunities.

### CLV Operators
Each CLV is managed by a designated operator responsible for executing market-making strategies. These strategies include managing bid and ask spreads, adjusting order sizes, and other essential market-making activities. Operators have significant freedom in developing their approaches; however, the smart contract enforces several restrictions to prevent malicious actions and protect the interests of liquidity providers.
