## What is Sonic Market?

Sonic Market is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sonic blockchain, designed to bring a fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) experience. Unlike traditional Automated Market Makers (AMMs), Sonic Market leverages its advanced order book technology, **LOBSTER (Limit Order Book with Segment Tree for Efficient oRder-matching)**, to provide fast, gas-efficient order matching directly on the Sonic blockchain.

Sonic Market aims to deliver the precision and flexibility of centralized exchanges (CEX) while maintaining the decentralization, security, and transparency of on-chain trading. It enables traders to take full control of their trading experience with customizable order parameters and instant settlement.
