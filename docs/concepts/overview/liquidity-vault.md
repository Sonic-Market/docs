## Sonic Liquidity Vault (SLV)

### What is SLV?

The **Sonic Liquidity Vault (SLV)** empowers users to passively provide liquidity to the Sonic Market's on-chain order book. By depositing assets into the SLV, liquidity providers can earn profits from the bid-ask spread, which is generated through the vault's active market-making strategies. This setup ensures that users do not need to actively manage their positions; instead, SLV operates on their behalf, seizing trading opportunities.

### SLV Operators

Each SLV is managed by a designated operator responsible for implementing and executing market-making strategies. These strategies include:

- Managing bid and ask spreads.
- Adjusting order sizes.
- Other essential activities related to market-making.

While operators have significant flexibility in designing their strategies, smart contract-level restrictions ensure the safety of liquidity providers, protecting them from malicious actions and mismanagement.

### Key Features:

1. **Passive Liquidity Provisioning**: SLV allows users to provide liquidity on Sonic Market without active involvement.
2. **Trustless Operation**: The vault runs on a fully decentralized and transparent protocol, ensuring users maintain control over their assets.
